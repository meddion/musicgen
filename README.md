It's important to note that the MIDI format is a representation of the performance of a song rather than the score, so it's not guaranteed that the dataset will have the same song from different artists or even from the same artist in different performances. In order to use the dataset effectively, you may need to preprocess the data to extract the relevant information and format it in a way that can be used to train your model.
